        statement: `On 16 September 2022, Mahsa Jina Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died after she was arrested by the Islamic Republic’s
         morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict rules restricting the dress and conduct of women. The protests, which began
         in Amini’s hometown of Saqez, quickly intensified, spreading across the country with support from Iranians of all ages, genders, and ethnicities.
         The Islamic Republic responded by disrupting internet access, intimidating journalists, and violently repressing uprisings with state security forces.
         Because hospitals are controlled by the regime, anyone injured in the protest risks arrest and further abuse upon seeking medical attention. This photo-based
         video project narrates one chaotic night in the life of an Iranian nurse as she fights to save the life of a young man named Reza, who is badly wounded by crossfire
         at a protest. Reza is dying and needs immediate medical attention, but the nurse fears that if he is taken to a hospital he will be arrested rather than given medical care.
         Instead, at great risk to herself, she takes him home and gives him a blood transfusion from her own body, saving his life. Hossein Fatemi is an Iranian photographer who             encountered the nurse in the video while providing support to local Iranian photographers covering the protests. Images and video for this project were captured by local
         photojournalists, the nurse herself, and a photographer on assignment to cover her story. Journalists and photographers attempting to report on the protests face reprisals
         from the Iranian regime, ranging from intimidation to arrest and violent abuse. Due to state repression, it is difficult to know what is really happening inside the country.
         The photographers who captured the images seen here remain anonymous for security reasons.

    bio: `Samaneh Roghani (b. 1984) is an Iranian artist based in Malmö, Sweden. She holds a Bachelor’s 
    degree in Photography from Azad University in Tehran, as well as a BFA and an MFA from Malmö Art 
    Academy at Lund University. In her works, Roghani weaves together personal stories with universal 
    narratives about people struggling for a better life. There is opposition, resistance, and migration 
    in the face of fear, oppression, and persecution.
    Roghani employs a variety of media and techniques, including photography and video, to express herself. 
    She entwines her personal experiences by incorporating self-portraits into the very fabric of her works.
    Focusing on installations that give the audience a multi-sensory experience by combining visual, auditory, 
    and tactile elements, Roghani creates powerful immersive experiences that give a better understanding of 
    the conditions of our contemporary societies.
